# Current state of the project

* Problems have create, edit, delete and display done
* A a basic dashboard with basic authentication, password 1234 at /login

* Currently working on is_hidden and is_current attributes for problems and displaying them appropriatley but updating values does not seem to be working as I would hope, some debugging to be done on that.

* Soon will be working on a proper user system
